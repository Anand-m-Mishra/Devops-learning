1.Subnetting
- Subnet Mask: Divides IP into network and host parts (e.g., /24 means 255.255.255.0).
- Formula: 2^(32 - subnet bits) = Number of IPs.

2. DNS (Domain Name System)
- Converts domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IPs.
- DNS Records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT.

3. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network.

4. HTTP/HTTPS
- HTTP: Unsecured, plain text.
- HTTPS: Encrypted, secure via TLS/SSL.

5. Ports and Protocols
- Common Ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 53 (DNS), 25 (SMTP), 3306 (MySQL).
- TCP vs. UDP: TCP (reliable), UDP (fast, no guarantee).
