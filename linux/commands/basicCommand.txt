Showing hidden files: ls -a - Displays all files, including hidden ones.
Detailed listing: ls -l - Shows detailed information about files and directories.

Remember, you can always check the manual page for ls by typing man ls in your terminal for a complete list of options and detailed explanations. Don't be intimidated by the man pages - they're a treasure trove of information once you get used to reading them!

With these tools at your disposal, you're well-equipped to explore and manage files in any Linux system. The ls command is just the beginning of your Linux journey, but it's an essential tool that you'll use daily as you become more proficient with the operating system.

remember these key points:

1.Linux commands are often short and cryptic at first, but they're designed to be powerful and efficient once you learn them.
2.Most commands have many options that you can combine in various ways. Don't be afraid to experiment!
3.The terminal might seem intimidating at first, but it's an incredibly powerful tool that gives you precise control over your system.
4.Linux is case-sensitive. File.txt, file.txt, and FILE.txt are all different files in Linux.
5.The concepts we've learned with ls (like options and arguments) apply to many other Linux commands as well.

Use pwd to identify our current location in the file system.
Understand the concept of absolute paths.
Use pwd in conjunction with other commands like ls.
Explore the -L and -P options of the pwd command and understand their differences when dealing with symbolic links.
